Write a method that receives a string that contains brackets and validates if the sequence is correct.

Valid characters are: "(", ")", "[", "]", "{", "}".

Example:

```agsl

  s1 = "()[]{}" is valid
  s2 = "({})" is valid
  s3 = "([)]" is invalid
  s4 = "([]" is invalid
  s5 = "({[[{}(())]{[]}][]})" is valid

```
