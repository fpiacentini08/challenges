Given a string with multiple words separated by whitespace, return a map which contains each word as key and the number of occurrences as value.


For example:

```agsl
String inputString = "Hello this is a test string this is a test hello is this a test it is it is";

Map<String, Integer> responseMap = {
{"hello", 2},
{"this", 3},
{"is", 5},
{"a", 3},
{"test", 3},
{"string", 1},
{"it", 2}
}
```
